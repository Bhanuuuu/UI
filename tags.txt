1 	<!DOCTYPE...>

   This tag defines the document type and HTML version.

2 	<html>

   This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises of document header which is represented by <head>...</head> and document body which is represented by <body>...</body> tags.

3 	<head>

  This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML tags like <title>, <link> etc.

  The <title> tag is used inside the <head> tag to mention the document title.

5 	<body></body>

   This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags like <h1>, <div>, <p> etc.



6       <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>


    HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.

7        <p></p>


    The <p> tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p>

8     br        syntax:<br />    
   
    this tag is used to break the statement into next line
 
9   center     syntax:<center></center>

    this tag is used to put any content in the center of the page or any table cell  

10  hr      syntax:<hr>
  
     The <hr> tag creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line accordingly.

11   pre    syntax:<pre></pre>

     Sometimes, you want your text to follow the exact format of how it is written in the HTML document. In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag <pre>.

Any text between the opening <pre> tag and the closing </pre> tag will preserve the formatting of the source document
EXAMPLE:      <pre>
         function testFunction( strText ){
            alert (strText)
         }
      </pre>
12  Nonbreaking Spaces

   Suppose you want to use the phrase "12 Angry Men." Here, you would not want a browser to split the "12, Angry" and "Men" across two lines -
  EX:       <p>An ?exampleof this technique appears in the movie "12&nbsp;Angry&nbsp;Men."</p>

13  b  syntax:<b></b>

    it will give the text in BOLD Format

17   Monospaced Font  <tt></tt> 
     The content of a <tt>...</tt> element is written in monospaced font. Most of the fonts are known as variable-width fonts because different letters are of different widths (for example, the letter 'm' is wider than the letter 'i'). In a monospaced font, however, each letter has the same width.
    example:      <p>The following word uses a <tt>monospaced</tt> typeface.</p>
     
18  Superscript Text  <sup></sup>
    The content of a <sup>...</sup> element is written in superscript; the font size used is the same size as the characters surrounding it but is displayed half a character's height above the other characters.

23   SPAN  <span></span>  
     The <span> element, on the other hand, can be used to group inline elements only. So, if you have a part of a sentence or paragraph which you want to group together, you could use the <span> element as follows.
     Example:<p>This is the example of <span style = "color:green">span tag</span>
         and the <span style = "color:red">div tag</span> alongwith CSS</p>

29   Defination tag <def></def>
     The <dfn>...</dfn> element (or HTML Definition Element) allows you to specify that you are introducing a special term. It's usage is similar to italic words in the midst of a paragraph.
     Typically, you would use the <dfn> element the first time you introduce a key term. Most recent browsers render the content of a <dfn> element in an italic font.
     Example:      <p>The following word is a <dfn>special</dfn> term.</p>

30   quoting text   <blockquote>...</blockquote>
     when you want to quote a passage from another source, you should put it in between <blockquote>...</blockquote> tags.
     Text inside a <blockquote> element is usually indented from the left and right edges of the surrounding text, and sometimes uses an italicized font.<blockquote>XHTML 1.0 is the W3C's first Recommendation for XHTML,following on 
     example: <blockquote>XHTML 1.0 is the W3C's first Recommendation for XHTML,following on

32   Text Citations <cite></cite>
     If you are quoting a text, you can indicate the source placing it between an opening <cite> tag and closing </cite> tag
     As you would expect in a print publication, the content of the <cite> element is rendered in italicized text by default.
     Example       <p>This HTML tutorial is derived from <cite>W3 Standard for HTML</cite>.</p>

33   Computer Code <code></code>
     Any programming code to appear on a Web page should be placed inside <code>...</code> tags. Usually the content of the <code> element is presented in a monospaced font, just like the code in most programming books.
     Example:      <p>Regular text. <code>This is code.</code> Regular text.</p>

34   Keyboard Text <kbd></kbd>

37   Table <table></table>
     defines table for content
    <table></table>
 
38   The HTML tables are created using the <table> tag in which the <tr> tag is used to create table rows and <td> tag is used to create data cells. The elements under <td> are regular and left aligned by default
     Example
    <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>

   <head>
      <title>HTML Tables</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <table border = "1">
         <tr>
            <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
            <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
            <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      
   </body>
</html>

   
39   Table Heading

Table heading can be defined using <th> tag. This tag will be put to replace <td> tag, which is used to represent actual data cell. Normally you will put your top row as table heading as shown below, otherwise you can use <th> element in any row. Headings, which are defined in <th> tag are centered and bold by default.
Example

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>HTML Table Header</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <table border = "1">
         <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Salary</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Ramesh Raman</td>
            <td>5000</td>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <td>Shabbir Hussein</td>
            <td>7000</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </body>
   
</html>
40   HTML Unordered Lists

An unordered list is a collection of related items that have no special order or sequence. This list is created by using HTML <ul> tag. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet.
Example


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>HTML Unordered List</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <ul>
         <li>Beetroot</li>
         <li>Ginger</li>
         <li>Potato</li>
         <li>Radish</li>
      </ul>
   </body>
   
</html>
The type Attribute

You can use type attribute for <ul> tag to specify the type of bullet you like. By default, it is a disc. Following are the possible options -

<ul type = "square">
<ul type = "disc">
<ul type = "circle">

   
41 HTML Ordered Lists

      If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, then HTML ordered list will be used. This list is created by using <ol> tag. The numbering starts at one and is incremented by one for each successive ordered list element tagged with <li>.
     Example


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>HTML Ordered List</title>
   </head>

   <body>
      <ol>
         <li>Beetroot</li>
         <li>Ginger</li>
         <li>Potato</li>
         <li>Radish</li>
      </ol>
   </body>

</html>

42   HTML Definition Lists

    HTML and XHTML supports a list style which is called definition lists where entries are listed like in a dictionary or encyclopedia. The definition list is the ideal way to present a glossary, list of terms, or other name/value list.

    Definition List makes use of following three tags.

    <dl> - Defines the start of the list
    <dt> - A term
    <dd> - Term definition
    </dl> - Defines the end of the list

Example


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>HTML Definition List</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <dl>
         <dt><b>HTML</b></dt>
         <dd>This stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</dd>
         <dt><b>HTTP</b></dt>
         <dd>This stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</dd>
      </dl>
   </body>
	
</html>

43  Linking Documents <a></a>

    A link is specified using HTML tag <a>. This tag is called anchor tag and anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag becomes part of the link and a user can click that part to reach to the linked document. Following is the simple syntax to use <a> tag.
    <a href = "Document URL" ... attributes-list>Link Text</a> 
 

44   Use of Base Path  <base></base>
     When you link HTML documents related to the same website, it is not required to give a complete URL for every link. You can get rid of it if you use <base> tag in your HTML document header. This tag is used to give a base path for all the links. So your browser will concatenate given relative path to this base path and will make a complete URL.
     Example:<base href="www.jdoa.com"></base>
 


45  for mail 
    <a href = "mailto: abc@example.com">Send Email</a>  
 
 
46  Frames <frameset></frameset>  
     HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns
     To use frames on a page we use <frameset> tag instead of <body> tag. The <frameset> tag defines, how to divide the window into frames. The rows attribute of <frameset> tag defines horizontal frames and cols attribute defines vertical frames. Each frame is indicated by <frame> tag and it defines which HTML document shall open into the frame.
     Eg:<frameset rows = "10%,80%,10%">
      <frame name = "top" src = "/html/top_frame.htm" />
      <frame name = "main" src = "/html/main_frame.htm" />
      <frame name = "bottom" src = "/html/bottom_frame.htm" />
      </frameset>


47  iframe    <iframe></iframe>
    The <iframe> tag is not somehow related to <frameset> tag, instead, it can appear anywhere in your document. The <iframe> tag defines a rectangular region within the document in which the browser can display a separate document, including scrollbars and borders. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
    <iframe src = "/html/menu.htm" width = "555" height = "200">
         Sorry your browser does not support inline frames.
      </iframe>
      

    Block Elements

Block elements appear on the screen as if they have a line break before and after them. For example, the <p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <dl>, <pre>, <hr />, <blockquote>, and <address> elements are all block level elements. They all start on their own new line, and anything that follows them appears on its own new line.
 
Inline Elements

Inline elements, on the other hand, can appear within sentences and do not have to appear on a new line of their own. The <b>, <i>, <u>, <em>, <strong>, <sup>, <sub>, <big>, <small>, <li>, <ins>, <del>, <code>, <cite>, <dfn>, <kbd>, and <var> elements are all inline elements.

Grouping HTML Elements

There are two important tags which we use very frequently to group various other HTML tags (i) <div> tag and (ii) <span> tag


48  Div tag <div></div>
    This is the very important block level tag which plays a big role in grouping various other HTML tags and applying CSS on group of elements. Even now <div> tag can be used to create webpage layout where we define different parts (Left, Right, Top etc.) of the page using <div> tag. This tag does not provide any visual change on the block but this has more meaning when it is used with CSS.
    <div style = "color:red">
         <h4>This is first group</h4>
         <p>Following is a list of vegetables</p>
         
         <ul>
            <li>Beetroot</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Potato</li>
            <li>Radish</li>
         </ul>
      </div>


49  font tag <font></font>
    In this tag we can give size,style,face etc
    <font size = "1">Font size = "1"</font><br />


50  form tag  <form> </form>
    The HTML <form> tag is used to create an HTML form and it has following syntax -

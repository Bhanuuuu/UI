            <h5 class="card-title">BADRAKALI TEMPLE </h5>
            <p class="card-text"> Goddess Bhadrakali is one of the ten great manifestations of the Supreme Goddess of Hindu cosmic mythology and the Bhadrakali temple at Warangal is devoted to the god of rage and fury and protector of the goodness from the darkness. The temple is in a real sense an ancient one â€“ dating back to 625 AD to the era of the Chalukyan kings or so is depicted from the in-house inscriptions. Not just history and mysticism, the magnificent temple is an attraction because of its picturesque beauty of natural rock formation and the vast lake that creates an undeniable spiritual serenity about the place. Tourists can simply enjoy the soft breeze and take in the vast expanse of it, or choose to go boating as well.

            <p class="card-text">
                

The Thousand Pillar Temple is an ancient temple that is tucked away in a small town named Hanamakonda in the vibrant state of Telangana. As the name suggests, the temple has over one thousand pillars, some of which are a part or extension of adjacent pillars! These pillars are so tightly knit, they practically form the walls of the temple. Constructed in a star-shaped architecture, the Thousand Pillars Temple is a popular pilgrimage centre which welcomes more than 1000 devotees almost every day. The temple also contains a huge monolith Nandi, made up of black basalt stone. The three shrines located in the temple are together known as Trikootalayam.

The mighty temple is a true specimen of Kakatiya architecture and Chalukyan architecture both, and this does a great job of enhancing its already overwhelming beauty.  There are three presiding deities in this temple- Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu and Lord Surya. According to the Hindu traditions, Lord Vishnu is the preserver of the universe- the one who ensures that elements of vitality are preserved to strike the balance, Lord Shiva is the destroyer of the universe- the one who destroys negative elements of the universe and give way to the birth of a new beginning, and Lord Surya- the sun god, the one who sustains the whole universe by his warmth; without whom the whole universe would be just an enormous pit of darkness. And to think that this temple houses the shrines of all the three mighty lords under one roof, a compelling reason to witness this powerhouse of positive vibes and uplifting energy. The temple was built by Rudra Deva and hence houses a deity in his name too.

                <p class="card-text">

                    Warangal is prominent for the several remarkable lakes it has incorporated in its topography, it was also the former capital of Kakatiya dynasty. Laknavaram Cheruvu or Laknavaram Lake is a man-made wonder tucked away from civilisation in the Govindaraopet just 80 kilometres from Warangal, cradled by lush green dense forest cover and glorious hills. Laknavaram lake in the Bhupalpally district in the state of Telangana is locally famous by the name of Laknavaram Cheruvu. The lake amasses an area of over a whopping 10,000 acres. and was built by the Kakatiya clan when Warangal served as their capital.
                    
                    What is seemingly unique about Laknavaram is that it has 13 small islands spread across it within the lake and 160-meter-long three individual suspension bridges that connect 3 islands with each other and the main shore. The lake also has a medley of activities for you to choose from for people of all walks of life and age groups and you could spend your day amidst gusts of breeze and revelling in the splendid views of the mountains and a sea of green as far your eyes can see.
